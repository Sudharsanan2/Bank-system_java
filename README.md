Handle invalid operations like depositing into a non-existent account.

# Why use this code?

This code is helpful for,

Learning OOP concepts in Java.

Understanding data storage using HashMap.

Practicing basic user-defined class creation (Account, Bank).

Simulating real-world systems like banking in code.

Reusable design – easy to extend with features like withdrawal, transfer, interest calculation, etc.
